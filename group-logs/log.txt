    Team NaiveMonster conisting of Alex Shelton, Hunter Burden, Ben Bauer, and AJ stein was formed. We decided on an idea, being that we would create a website
    where people could find those interesting in similar activites to them and plan and make groups for them.

Febraury 4, 2020
    The group repo was created by Alex Shelton. The rest of group was added and meeting times were discussed. Tuesdays at 6 and Saturdays at 3 were decided. Initial
    task such as Alex, AJ, and Ben editing the README and Hunter deleting the __pycache__ files were doled out.

February 11, 2020
    Alex set up the repository and most of the intial files such as main. We discussed how to build the virtual enironment and made it homework to build it by Saturday.

February 15, 2020
    After we had all set up our virtual enironments we mostly discussed what we wanted in for our website. Discussions included what pages we think would be best,
    such as an about us and contact us, and how we would desire people to use the app. Login requries and emial to signup, with users creating a username and 
    password, as well as entering their location and a bio to help them find people. To find people it was decided that users would make posts similar to Twitter
    where users make "posts" with the activty, a description, date, and duration of actvity.

February 18, 2020
    Plans for the future and more roles are decided. Ben makes the about_us page, Hunter creates the contact_us, AJ works on various front end HTML pages, and Alex
    works on the posts and how they are created and intereact with other pages.

Febraury 22, 2020
    Hunter Burden was out of town at RevolutionUC so it was decided to simply wait until Tuesday and have everyone due their tasks.

February 25, 2020
    After working on the Doxygen homework, Due to other classes we mostly agreed to do simple tasks such as update our about us pages and remove any
    unessecary branches, so that everyone could focus.

Febraury 28, 2020
    Most of the discussion was based around the color scheme we would be using for the website. We decided it would be colors in our CSS styling and we also discussed
    who would be taking what files and formatting them. 

March 3, 2020
    It was discussed that we would all take the time to learn HTML and CSS formatting and styling in order to make the website look pleasing and usable. We have all
    decided to take various pages. Alex will take the main page, Ben will take the about us page, Hunter will work on contact us, and AJ will work on the login.
    The deicded color scheme will include mainly purple and black. Some other potential supporting colors such as white, red, and blue could be used in smaller
    amounts to create a little diversity.

    During our meeting it was discussed whether we would continue to our project or change it. It was decided to continue on, albiet possibly scale the project back 
    in anticipation of any troubles we could encounter due to not being able to meet in person.

March 28, 2020
    The meeting consisted of us discussing what was still needed. It was decided that our landing page needed more detail and user interface. Currently it still 
    needs to link to the about and contact pages. Posts by users would need more interaction as well, such as possibly commenting on them or allowing users to enter 
    a group chat of sorts when connecting through posts. We have been discussing how to implement those ideas. Finally we through around idea for how to customize
    profile pages. Including allowing pictures, bios, interests, and other customization options.

March 31, 2020
    Design ideas for the landing page were discussed. It was decided to put a logo on the left, as well as a sort of brief synopsis or hook under neath it that
    briefly explains the website. There were discussion about getting rid of the contact_us page, but ultimate it was decided to keep it.

April 4, 2020
    Discussions on the to do list were held. We began to discuss how we would like for users to communicate, and if we would be able to learn socketing on our own. 
    Other features for users like profile pictures, and what other activites we would like to add were also discussed.

April 7, 2020
    It was decided to shelve the socketing idea, and find another way to users to communicate on the site. Some activites, like more sports such as football, and 
    games like Fortnite were agreed upon. Ideas for a sidebar, as well as a possible search bar were discuessed.

April 11, 2020
    Final ideas and preparations were beginning to be made. Since their is only a little over a week of time left to work on the site it was discuessed what the
    most important ideas and implementations were. Anything that wasn't deemed important enough would be thrown out in favor of having a more ready, if slightly
    stripped down, website.

April 13, 2020
    There was a very short meeting consisting of talking about some ideas that could to be done. While the website is in a usable state, it could probably use
    some quality of life features that would make it more appealing and helpful, such as bios, profile pictures, and comments

April 18, 2020
    The meeting mostly stood as a progress update of what was about to happen. Completion the bios and profile pics were done, and how to implement comments was
    also discuessed
