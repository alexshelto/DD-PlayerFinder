    Team NaiveMonster conisting of Alex Shelton, Hunter Burden, Ben Bauer, and AJ stein was formed. We decided on an idea, being that we would create a website
    where people could find those interesting in similar activites to them and plan and make groups for them.

Febraury 4, 2019
    The group repo was created by Alex Shelton. The rest of group was added and meeting times were discussed. Tuesdays at 6 and Saturdays at 3 were decided. Initial
    task such as Alex, AJ, and Ben editing the README and Hunter deleting the __pycache__ files were doled out.

    Alex set up the repository and most of the intial files such as main. We discussed how to build the virtual enironment and made it homework to build it by Saturday.

    After we had all set up our virtual enironments we mostly discussed what we wanted in for our website. Discussions included what pages we think would be best,
    such as an about us and contact us, and how we would desire people to use the app. Login requries and emial to signup, with users creating a username and 
    password, as well as entering their location and a bio to help them find people. To find people it was decided that users would make posts similar to Twitter
    where users make "posts" with the activty, a description, date, and duration of actvity.

    Plans for the future and more roles are decided. Ben makes the about_us page, Hunter creates the contact_us, AJ works on various front end HTML pages, and Alex
    works on the posts and how they are created and intereact with other pages.
